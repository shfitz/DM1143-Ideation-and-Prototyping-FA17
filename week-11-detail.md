<ul><li>Read this <a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/speculative-design-design-niche-or-new-tool-government-innovation">article on speculative design</a> and its potential impact. In your blog, write up how your work (not the final project but your professional work) leverage properties of speculative design? Is this something you already engage in? Or do you not find this a meaningful way to think about your work? Why not?</li></ul>

<ul><li>Write up a list of things that inspired your object. How do these things influnce your thinng of your design? Movies, books, games, exisitng objects, and so on are all fair game.</li></ul>

<!-- Due Mon next week -->
<ul><li>Look at the object you made. What about it has changed in your mind now that you have a first, lo-fi prototype. What was unexpected? What worked the way you thought it would? How will you address these issues?</li><li>Write your weekly input or output post.</li></ul>

  <td><ul><li>Now that you have one version of your project under your belt, it's time to roll up your sleeves and make another one. Identify what you want the final materials to be in your prototype. Over the weeked, start to make sketches, paper, or other lo-fi prototypes of your object. Each time you make a version, identify what works for you and what doesn't. Document the prototype on your blog in video or still images. Bring it to class if possible. This is still supposed to be a rough draft, don't worry if it's not what you hoped it would be (in fact, that's pretty much the point).</li></ul>

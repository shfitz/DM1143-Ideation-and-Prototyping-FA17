# Input Map

Create a mind map or concept map of all of the various inputs in your life \(i.e. this is the total range of what comes into you from outside of your own imagination.\)

Post to your process website. You may have to upload micro and macro views of your map as images.

Here's a "[how to mind map](https://imindmap.com/how-to-mind-map/)" explanation.

For those of you who want to use a digital tool you might consider using one of the following:

* [Coggle](https://coggle.it/)
* [Freemind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)
* [Inspiration Software](http://www.inspiration.com/Inspiration)
* [OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle)

NB : it's totally possible to use tools like Illustrator and Inkscape as well. It;s just that the ones above have a lot of built in functionality.

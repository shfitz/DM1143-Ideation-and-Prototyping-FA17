# Future Dystopia / Utopia Project


_This project can be done as a team or as an individual._

Imagine our civilization 20 years from now. Things have either collapsed beyond repair or life has become a harmonious dream. Through some odd wibbily wobbly timey wimey stuff, you have the opportunity to create a piece of information that will be sent back to the current time. What message would you send? You will brainstorm, research, sketch, map, design, and build prototypes your message. You will communicate your message in any final medium you choose. The only requirement is that it includes images, models, and video of your prototype(s).

You need to figure out a framing story. What is your imagined future like? 

You need to clearly define what the specific message you want to send back in time will be. 

You need to protoype the specific object you will be sending back in time. This prototype needs to be a physical object of some sort.

Here are some general themes to get you started, but you will need to eventually drill down from these very broad themes to specificity:

*   Animals
*   Commerce
*   Education
*   Engineering
*   Ethics
*   Information
*   Materiality
*   Media: Moving Image, Photography, Painting, Print, Sound, etc.
*   Memory
*   Nature
*   Networks
*   Ruins
*   Science
*   Sexuality
*   Systems
*   Technology
*   Time

We will be doing regular check ins on your progresss, staring first with the story that frames your object. Your message should follow from that. Once you have defined what your object is, you will be expected to prototype it through sketches, storyboards, and various physicla iterations. 3d renders are great for getting an idea started, but they are no match for a physical thing.

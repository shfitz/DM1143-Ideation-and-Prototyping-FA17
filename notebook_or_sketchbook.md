# Analog or Digital Notebook or Sketchbook

**Analog or Digital **

Acquire some kind of bound notebook or sketchbook to collect ideas, questions, loves, hates, inspiration, drawings, photos, visual and textual scraps, ephemera, fragments, imprints, rubbings, stains, odds and ends… Choose a notebook that is small enough that you will most likely keep with you (eg. pocket-sized or slightly larger) and use. Make it your own with stickers, markers, paint, collage, whatever. Carry this notebook with you at all times (as well as something to write with and a gluestick or tape) and use it often.

If you choose to do this digitally, I recommend Evernote or Paper by FiftyThree, but you can choose another application.

Occasionally, we will look at your notebooks (physical and digital) in class. Always carry it wth you.

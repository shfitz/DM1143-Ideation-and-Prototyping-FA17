<td>Download and read pages 39-43 on "Interviews" from IDEO's <a href="http://www.designkit.org//resources/1">Field Guide to Human Centered Design</a> (free download at the link). p 60-64 may also be helpful in getting a sense of your subject for the following assignment as well if you read it through the right lens. Generally, it's all good stuff.
